Friend Finder is is an application that uses Express.js and Node.js to allow its user to view and answer survey questions in order to meet a new friend with common interests.

### How It Works
* The user simply needs to click Go to Survey at which point they will need to type their name as well as a URL to a photo.
* The user then answers each question with a number (1 for Strongly Disagree and 5 for Strongly Agree).
* Once the user submits their survey answers they will receive a friend suggestion based on common answers.
